# Project Assignment 2
**Names:** CRISTIAN VERA Y ERNESTO CAMUS -
**Grupo:** 20

## Goals:
Everything is working ok, there are just 2 things that are not working yet.
1. the forgot password? it does not send the email and if you try if falls
2. the search in the home page, we dont know why it doesnt work in the home page but it
does in the lodgings page.
   
The location bonus is implemented but sometimes you cant see the location box in the lodging 
details, it seems to be an error from turbolinks.

The google sign in is implemented too, and it works properly. For some reason it just work with 
test accounts, so if you want to try it i will have to add your email to the google api test.

The faker works when you call db:seed. The lodgings that the faker creates are without
images so you will have to create a new lodging with imgs and videos to see it.

You can access to the report, and terms in the footer.
